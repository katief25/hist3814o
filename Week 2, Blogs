# Open Access Research, Readings

This idea of open access research is a fairly new one to me. I'm not used to hearing or reading about sharing your research with other individuals.
I think it is a good idea though, a definitely one that would be helpful to the majority of people, and through the readings it seems like many of the authors seem to agree.
By having open access, it could create an important dialogue between people from different fields, ages and backgrounds to share opinions and create a stronger database and platform. 
I have found that in my other history courses, there is some talk about historians sharing information and research, but it still always seems to be with colleagues or people known to them, rather than actually posting all their research for the world to see. 
As a student, I definitely see the benefits of open access research and what it could do for us as we're trying to learn and find our interests. By having access to all types of research, we have the potential to form laeger academic  bases, and understand the whole story, and different viewpoints on a given part of history, rather than being restricted to what we are able to access.
Although it is a great idea, and I think one that could be very beneifical, I understand that other issues could arise with plagarism, or ensuring that the work is truly yours. 

# Exercises

The exercises this week definitely taught me to be patient, and reread instructions where things may not be going as planned.
The first exercise had me stumped, when asking for pictures from creative commons. I did not understand what I was supposed to do and felt somewhat defeated, seeing as though it was the first of four exercises.
The second exercise, thankfully, went well. It lifted my spirits a bit, because starting off I didn't think I'd be able to do it. Seeing all the commands and instructions seemed intimidating, but going step by step I realized it wasn't as hard as I was expecting. I ran into a couple times where there were error messages, but thankfully I just went back a step, tried again and most of the time it worked.
This exercise definitely reminded me not to freak out the second something seems to be off, but rather to try again, because the error could be the result of a simple mistake. 
The third exercise also went well. The instructions were well laid out and I didn't really have any trouble doing this one.
The fourth exercise was were I got most stumped. I made it through 4.1 and 4.2 without too much difficulty, but when I got to 4.3 I couldn't get it to work. I decided to take a break and come back later to try again. Unfortunately, when I came back, I was more confused then when I had left it. It seemed like all my work was gone, and I wasn't sure what to do.
As a result, I decided it was probably best to stop, before getting overwhelmed and feeling defeated. 
I think that this week went fairly well overall. Other than some minor errors, which was expected, I definitely didn't feel like everything was out of control.

# Thoughts

I'm hoping that in the coming weeks I am able to keep making it farther into the exercises, and hopefully things continue to feel less daunting. 
The annotations, both in the readings and exercises, and helping eachother out has definitely relieved some of the stress I had coming into the course.
I'm definitely not the most tech savvy person, so knowing that there are other people around that are able to help out, and maybe I can help others out, is definitely helping me to not be as stressed. 
The course is definitely pushing me out of my comfort zone. It's one of the first times that I constantly find myself second guessing everything I'm doing, wondering if I'm on the right track at all. Hopefully I am, and if not hopefully I will be soon.
