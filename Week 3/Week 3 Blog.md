# Finding Data, Readings


# Exercises
The exercises this week definitely took some patience and perseverence, but overall it went okay.
The first exercise, I didn't have much issue with, and I found it to be quite interesting doing a search on something more personal. I also thought it was cool to see the way they were presented in the database. I'm still getting used to the DH box and how to use it, so that part stumped me a little bit, but it didn't take long for me to figure it out and get back on track. 

The second exercise definitely got a bit more difficult. The first section, following Ian Milligan's tutorial went well, however there were definitely parts where I felt it was taking longer than it should. In the end I was overthinking a bit, and I was doing it properly. For  Kellen Kurschinski's tutorial, I was overthinking and I kept thinking that I would somehow mess it up, and download too much. EVentually, I realized to just keep reading and follow the instructions, and once I did that, everything went smoothly.  

The third exercise is where I had a lot of trouble. It started off okay, but I found it got difficult quite quickly.  

# Thoughts
Overall the week went okay. I found that the readings were interested, and the exercises were definitely challenging. I've never taken a course that has pushed me so much, so I appreciate the fact that this course is offering me a different persepctive and new skills than any other class. I still have a long way to go, and still remind myself all the time when I'm working on this course to take my time and not get stressed.
I still find it somewhat discouraging that the third exercise had me really stumped, and once I got it and moved on to the fourth, I didn't understand. I realize my thinking needs to change somewhat, to become more focused on where I started, and where I am.  
It's getting better, and feeling slightly less overwhelming, thankfully. Looking forward to another week.
