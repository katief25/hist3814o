Exercise 1
•	Unsure how to create new file with nano
•	Opened $nano dhbox-work-today.md
•	Added notes about exercise to that file
•	Saved to file command, downloaded and then uploaded into github repository under week 3

 Exercise 2
•	Tried typing $wget-active history, said not found
•	Tried typing $mkdir wget-activehistory, didn’t do anything
•	Typed $cd wget-activehistory to open my new directory and it worked
•	Put url in (wget http://activehistory.ca/papers/)
o	The proper messages came up, I downloaded the first page of the website
•	Downloaded all papers from activehistory using $wget -r --no-parent -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/
o	Took awhile (18min, but thankfully everything worked)
•	Command for mirroring activehistory is $wget -m -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca
o	Useful for backing up entire website
•	I’m unsure of how to lodge my history
•	I can’t remember how to get my active history file to .md
o	Classmate responded, told me to do history > file name.md
•	Tried a couple, didn’t work
o	I got the document to be in my file manager, but since I came back to the exercise after some break, I had lost my history
o	I’ll try to redo it
•	I was overthinking the instructions a bit and got myself worried I was going to do something wrong
o	Ended up going forward and doing it right
•	Got to step 11, and I’m still not sure how to lodge it into repository
o	Figured out how to do it

Exercise 3
•	Everything up until encoding my transcription went well
•	Didn’t understand how to highlight, but checked slack and someone asked same question	
o	Answer: ‘mark up with tei encoding’
•	Not sure what it means by surround your text
o	Figured it out, watched tutorial
•	The page I chose isn’t the best… it didn’t really have specific people who were mentioned even with context
•	Not sure how to get to xml or xsl
•	Got to xml, but it isn’t coming up on webpage
•	Got an error saying not well formed on firefox
o	Thinking that I didn’t change to my xml extension correctly
•	Tried creating new folder with just xlm and xsl file… still didn’t work
•	Determined that the issue was in the first paragraph
•	Had made the n=citation, the full citation from the source that I used… NOT RIGHT!!!
o	Changed this to be the title of the article I read (still not sure if this is correct, but at least I got the site working!)
•	Googled a lot of things, because I thought I somehow didn’t make the xml file right… ended up I just had an error in my first paragraph
