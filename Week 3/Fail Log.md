# Exercise 2
1. Tried typing $wget-active history, said not found
2. Tried typing $mkdir wget-activehistory, didn’t do anything
3. Typed $cd wget-activehistory to open my new directory and it worked

5. The proper messages came up, I downloaded the first page of the website
6. Downloaded all papers from activehistory using $wget -r --no-parent -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/
7. Took awhile (18min, but thankfully everything worked)
8. Command for mirroring activehistory is $wget -m -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca
