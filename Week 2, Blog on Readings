# Open Access Research

This idea of open access research is a fairly new one to me. I'm not used to hearing or reading about sharing your research with other individuals.
I think it is a good idea though, a definitely one that would be helpful to the majority of people, and through the readings it seems like many of the authors seem to agree.
By having open access, it could create an important dialogue between people from different fields, ages and backgrounds to share opinions and create a stronger database and platform. 
I have found that in my other history courses, there is some talk about historians sharing information and research, but it still always seems to be with colleagues or people known to them, rather than actually posting all their research for the world to see. 
As a student, I definitely see the benefits of open access research and what it could do for us as we're trying to learn and find our interests. By having access to all types of research, we have the potential to form laeger academic  bases, and understand the whole story, and different viewpoints on a given part of history, rather than being restricted to what we are able to access.
Although it is a great idea, and I think one that could be very beneifical, I understand that other issues could arise with plagarism, or ensuring that the work is truly yours.
