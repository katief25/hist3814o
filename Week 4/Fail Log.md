# Exercise 1
1. This exercise went smoothly for me
2. I followed the instructions and read thoroughly, and didn't run into any problems
3. Edit: thought I did this properly, but when I had to use documents from this exercise in the next one, it wasn't working
4. Had to come back to this exercise and edit to try and make it work
5. Ended up editing the "sender, recipient, date" columns in this csv document... I'm not sure if there was a direct way to do this through DH box, but by editing in the document, it worked and had separate columns when uploading to openrefine

# Exercise 2
1. When I uploaded by csv file to open refine, the sender, recipient, date all came up as one column, rather than 3 separate columns
2. Have to go back to exercise 1 and figure out what I did wrong but I'm thinking that it could have been something small, perhaps the placement of my commas or extra spaces
3. I ended up editing in excel, making sure that they were their own 3 columns, and when I uploaded it onto openrefine, it worked
4. I ended up with way more entries then I needed... have to go back to first exercise because I must not have cleaned up my file properly 
5. When I clicked text facet, it said that there were too many results to display... not sure what I can do to change this and make the results visible
6. I changed the number of results to appear from 1000 to 200, and it allowed the results to show up!
7. I didn't get many results for merging, so I have to change my method to try and reduce this number. 
For the column sender, I have 194 choices whereas for recipient I have 30 choices... not sure that this is correct

# Exercise 3
I've read the instructions multiple times, and I'm not completely sure what I'm supposed to do... have to go reread the parts about sed and grep to try and understand better
