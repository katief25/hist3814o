# Exercise 1


# Exercise 2
1. When I uploaded by csv file to open refine, the sender, recipient, date all came up as one column, rather than 3 separate columns
2. Have to go back to exercise 1 and figure out what I did wrong but I'm thinking that it could have been something small, perhaps the placement of my commas or extra spaces
3. I ended up editing in excel, making sure that they were their own 3 columns, and when I uploaded it onto openrefine, it worked
4. I ended up with way more entries then I needed... have to go back to first exercise because I must not have cleaned up my file properly 
5. When I clicked text facet, it said that there were too many results to display... not sure what I can do to change this and make the results visible
