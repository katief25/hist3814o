# Readings 

The readings this week revealed a lot of patterns about different tools that are used. The article that stood out specifically to me, was the one on Corpus Linguistics for Historians. I thought that this article provided a lot of neat information and perspectives, that I had never even considered prior to doing this reading.

This reading specifically caught my interest, because I never have really considered how important and valuable words can be in a search, and how much they can reveal about the topic or event being researched. By picking out these patterns found in searches, you could find a lot of interesting data about how and why certain authors use words more or less. I found it particularly interesting how the author mentions that male authors tended to use the word "women" less, when discussing women suffrage, because of the negative connotation attached to it, whereas women authors on the other hand would use it more frequently. Finding patterns such as this, can help in understanding the society and time frame, as well as the thought patterns of certain communities and even the world more broadly. 

I think that picking out specific words is a different approach that could serve very well, because as humans when we read, we tend to skip over certain words or phrases that seem unimportant. However, if you're trying to use these words to find patterns it can be very revealing and useful in research going forward. 

# Exercises

The exercises this week went more smoothly than some of the past weeks for sure. I think most of the issues I ran into this week were with the downloading of different softwares/programs, however overall most of the issues got figured out.  

The first exercise was a little bit rough. I got it started well, and was part way through when I couldn't find certain tabs that it was saying to 'run.' Eventually, I figured it out, but the formatting of the program on my computer was a bit weird. It kept glitching, covering up the layout tab, and the left side of the screen, which I had to access. Again, after closing the program and trying to figure it out, I got it working and it went well. I got through the rest of the exercise without many issues, but unfortunetly at the end, I couldn't get it so that the names appeared in the preview. I watched the tutrial multiple times, refreshed the preview however it wasn't working. I'm not exactly sure what the issue was, but I figured it wasn't too big of a deal.   

The second exercise didn't go over too well. To start, I didn't have the war diary text files, but after checking slack, I noticed another classmate had the same issue. I followed the instructions to use another file, I uploaded it to my File Manager, however when I went onto the command line, it didn't show that it was there. After messing around a bit, and refreshing I noticed it there. The main issue that I ran into, multiple times was when I was trying to bring the zip file into the Topic Modelling tool. My computer would not give me the option of opening the file in this application, so I wasn't sure what to do. I ended up moving past this exercise and figured I'd come back and try again. However, after coming back, I still couldn't get it to open with this tool. 

The third exercise went well until about half way through. At first I got stuck at the section with the en.txt and there kept being an error message. I went through this exercise multiple times to try and advance forward, but unfortunately the furthest I could get was to the Reading Data from a Directory section. Once I was at this point, I was unable to get to the next part.

Despite not having completely finished exercise 3, I decided to try the fourth one. This exercise was really straight forward and I got through it no problem. I actually found this one quite interesting to look at and play around with to see the word cloud and context in which words were used. 

Since the fourth exercise went well I decided I would try the fifth one. However, after reading through the tutorial for this one, and trying to get started, I found it quite difficult and wasn't able to do it. 

# Thoughts

This week went went fairly well. I think that the hardest part for me was figuring out how the programs worked, especially when they were glitching and not appearing exactly the way they should. I think overall I did well at taking breaks when I needed to, and working when I thought I was ready. I'm not the most techy person, so seeing myself use all these tools was really fun, and I'm glad that this course has been able to provide me with resources and tools that I could definitely see myself continuing to use. I'm going to try and do some more of the exercises from this past week, considering there were 14, I feel like trying to give a couple more a go. We'll see how it goes!
