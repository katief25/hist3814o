# Exercise 1
1. Can’t seem to find the “connected components” in order to click run (step 8)
2. Figured it out, layout was just a bit weird and had to scroll over to see the run button (took a couple minutes to realize I could do this)
3. I’m not exactly sure what happened, but I think gephi froze, and I lost what I had done up until step 16
4. Having to restart from step 1… I’m not sure why but I saved my workspace, however it wasn’t coming up with everything I had just done
5. I think the program is glitching, because I can’t see all the tabs that I need
6. The overview section still glitches, and doesn’t allow me to click run when choosing the format
7. Ended up figuring out the glitch
8. At the end, I couldn’t get it so that my preview section showed the names of the people… I double checked to make sure the right filters were applied, and refreshed several times, but it wouldn’t show the names

# Exercise 2
1. I’m not sure if perhaps I didn’t do the war diary files correctly back when it was an exercise, however I don’t have the war diary text files, only the war diary
2. EDIT: Checked in on slack and someone else had the same issue, so I followed the directions to continue on the exercise
3. Trying to use CND.txt, but it won’t let me zip the file, not sure what I’m doing incorrectly 
4. I’ve changed the command, replacing war-diary-text with CND, but it is saying deflated (65%)
5. When I made this zip, it had many more files than shown in the tutorial
6. It won’t let me bring into the topic modelling tool
7. EDIT: Tried with CND.zip file, and it also didn’t work
8. Wouldn’t give me the option to use this tool

# Exercise 3
1. Getting stuck at the en.txt part
2. Coming up with error message (which I saw in tutorial, but it isn’t coming up with the next part)
3. Keep getting error messages when I try and ‘run’ things
4. I’ll have to look through and see if I can find where the error occurred, or whether I should start again
5. I’m getting stuck at the reading data from a directory… can’t seem to find my path
6. I’ve tried multiple times, but I can’t seem to get it

# Exercise 4
1. This exercise was really straightforward
2. I didn’t run into any issues
3. Thought it was interesting to see this layout and how it could definitely be useful for research
