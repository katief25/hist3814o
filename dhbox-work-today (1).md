In this exercise, I'm trying to figure out how to use Nano and the different resources in the
DH box.

The url of the search I made on CWGC was https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?lastName=Foran 
Downloaded results as an excel document onto my computer
31 individuals came up with my last name

For the second website, I'm trying to figure out how it works. I've gotten a few results, one from putting 
Foran under the name and one from selecting Christianity/Judaism.
